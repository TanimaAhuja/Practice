  “Travel in the youngest sort,” says Bacon, “Is a part of education; in the elder, a part of experience.” Some may think otherwise. To them, visiting churches and monasteries, castles and fortifications, antiques and ruins as well as libraries and colleges is a sheer waste of time. They may further say that one could read the accounts of these or watch the movies that cover the important places of the world. They forget that the touch of living and breathing reality gives a different type of sensation and satisfaction. Travelling may be an expensive hobby but it compensates for the financial loss. If a traveller has interest in life and its manifestations, he can explore a lot to keep himself absorbed and happy. A student of sociology can gather much from the customs and rituals of life of the people living in different regions of the world. A student of history can discover a vivid account of history in the historical monuments. An engineer can enrich his knowledge by looking at the engineering feats at different places. In fact, one can find everything that satisfies one’s intellectual and adventurous cravings.
  As a hobby, travelling keeps us busy during leisure; it is the best method to utilise time. Until a person breaks from the dull routine, physically and mentally, he cannot find satisfaction; travelling helps us to achieve this break and rejuvenates us. At a new place, one is curious to know and eager to gather information. He gets thrills and surprises that keep his interests alive. While travelling, one comes across a large number of people. In case one has a psychological bent of mind one increases one’s experience and power to understand others. Understanding human nature is perhaps the best part of education. Travelling satisfies all the demands of a good hobby; it is absorbing, educative and refreshing for the mind and the body.
